# Project: Weather App

## Step 1: Create a new Django project
- Run the command "django-admin startproject weatherapp" in the terminal
- This will create a new directory called "weatherapp" in your current location, which will contain the basic file structure for a Django project.

## Step 2: Create a new app within the project
- Run the command "python manage.py startapp weather"
- This command will create a new directory called "weather" within your project directory.
- Add the app to the list of installed apps in the settings.py file of the project

## Step 3: Retrieving weather and location data
- Sign up for an API key from OpenWeather
- Use the requests library to make a GET request to the OpenWeather API's endpoint to retrieve the weather data
- Use the GeoIP2 library to retrieve a user's location based on their IP address
- Parse the json data and extract the information you need

## Step 4: Create a view
- Create a view that handles the logic for retrieving the weather and location data and renders it to a template

## Step 5: Create a template
- Create a template that displays the weather and location data to the user

## Step 6: Deploy the app
- Deploy the app to a web hosting server, such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean, by following the steps provided by the hosting service
